UConn Bootcamp Module 3: JavaScript Robot Gladiators<br />
Following UConn Bootcamp's tutorial guide to learn about JavaScript - create a minimal viable product, MVP, combat simulator game called Robot Gladiators without CSS.  <br />
<br/>
Built With:
- HTML
- JavaScript

## DESCRIPTION

Tutorial Lessons:

- Lesson 1: JavaScript Basics
    - Communicate with the game player by using JavaScript functions.
    - Assign and manipulate data using JavaScript variables and operators.
    - Control the flow of the application by managing conditional statements.
- Lesson 2: Use Loops to Enable Multiple Battle Rounds
    - Create a `[for]` loop to execute multiple statements repeatedly in a concise format.
    - Iterate through an array of elements.
    - Use conditional statements to control the flow of the application.
    - Debug the application using the `[debugger]` statement and Chrome's DevTools.
- Lesson 3: Expand Game Logic into Multiple Functions
    - Organize the codebase by using functions.
    - Control the flow of the application by using functions.
    - Understand different levels of scoping in JavaScript.
- Lesson 4: Optimize the Code with Objects
    - Create objects and their associated methods and properties to organize data in the application.
    - Understand the utility of the built-in objects, including how to use them, when they can be used, and what methods and properties are available.
    - Return values back to the function call by using the keyword `[return]`.
- Lesson 5: Resolve Bugs and Add Final Enhancements
    - Store data by using the Web Storage API.
    - Validate player prompts by using the `[while]` loop.
    - Add more variability to the game by using the `[Math.random()]` function.
